I am a postdoc in the group of Prof. Johannes Schmidt-Hieber at the Department of Applied Mathematics ([DAMUT](https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/damut/#))at University of Twente. 

Before coming to the University of Twente, I did postdocs with Prof. Claudia Strauch at Aarhus University from 2022 to 2024 and Prof. Sören Christensen at Kiel University in 2022. I obtained my PhD in 2022 at Aarhus University under the supervision of Prof. Claudia Strauch.

I am interested in the following research areas:
Statistics for stochastic processes, biologically plausible learning, theoretical foundations for large language models, data-driven stochastic optimal control, high-dimensional statistics, nonparametric statistics, transfer learning
